# HTML Javascript Syntax Error: Incorrect comparison operators

This repository demonstrates a common error in HTML where less-than and greater-than symbols (&lt; and &gt;) are incorrectly used within a Javascript code block embedded in an HTML file, causing a syntax error.  The solution shows the correct way to use these symbols within Javascript code embedded in HTML.

## Bug
The bug lies in the use of HTML entities (&lt; and &gt;) instead of the actual less-than and greater-than operators within a Javascript code snippet.

## Solution
The solution shows how to correctly use the less-than and greater-than operators within the Javascript code block.  The HTML entities should not be used in this context.
